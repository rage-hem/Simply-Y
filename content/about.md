Simply-y is the cumulation of over 30 years of experience in building, engaging and redefining organisations in the corporate environment.

It was started out of frustraion. Many consultancy companies offer help to improve productivity and we have engaged with several over our careers. But it always felt as if there was something missing. There never seemed to be a focus on the longer term fixes, the people and culture, it was very short term. We want to share what we know, share our experience and insight to help and inspire other people and companies to change.
